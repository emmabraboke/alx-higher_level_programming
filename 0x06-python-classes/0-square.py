    """Square
    Square,in geometry, a plane figure with four
    equal sides and four right (90°) angles.
    A square is a special kind of rectangle (an equilateral one)
    A square has four axes of symmetry, and its
    two finite diagonals (as with any rectangle) are equal.
    Bisection of a square by a diagonal results in two right triangles.
    If the length of the side of a square is s, then
    the area of the square is s2, or “s squared.”
